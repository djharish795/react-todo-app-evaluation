# 🚀 GitHub Pages Deployment Fix

## ✅ **Issue Resolved**

The 404 error was occurring because GitHub Pages was trying to serve your **source code** instead of the **built React application**.

## 🔧 **What We Fixed**

### 1. **Added Homepage URL**
```json
"homepage": "https://djharish795.github.io/react-todo-app-evaluation"
```

### 2. **Added Deployment Scripts**
```json
"scripts": {
  "predeploy": "npm run build",
  "deploy": "gh-pages -d build"
}
```

### 3. **Installed gh-pages Package**
```bash
npm install --save-dev gh-pages
```

## 🌐 **Your Live App URLs**

After deployment completes, your React Todo App will be available at:

### **Live Demo URL:**
🔗 **https://djharish795.github.io/react-todo-app-evaluation**

### **Repository URL:**
📂 **https://github.com/djharish795/react-todo-app-evaluation**

## 🚀 **Deployment Commands**

```bash
# Build and deploy (this is running now)
npm run deploy

# Or do it step by step:
npm run build    # Creates optimized production build
npm run deploy   # Deploys to GitHub Pages
```

## ⚡ **How It Works**

1. **Source Code** → Stored in `main` branch
2. **Built App** → Deployed to `gh-pages` branch  
3. **GitHub Pages** → Serves from `gh-pages` branch

## 🎯 **What Your HR Team Will See**
