# Quick GitHub Setup Commands

## 🚀 Manual Setup (Replace with your details)

```bash
# Replace YOUR_USERNAME with your actual GitHub username

git push -u origin main
```

## 📝 Suggested Repository Names
- `react-todo-app-evaluation`
- `todo-app-enhanced`
- `react-task-manager`
- `todo-evaluation-project`
- `advanced-react-todo`

## 🔧 Example Commands (customize these)

```bash
# Example 1: If your username is "john-doe" and repo is "react-todo-app-evaluation"
git remote add origin https://github.com/john-doe/react-todo-app-evaluation.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main

## ⚠️ Important Notes

1. **Create the repository on GitHub first**: Go to https://github.com/new
2. **Make it public** if it's for evaluation purposes
3. **Don't initialize with README** (we already have one)
4. **Copy the repository URL** from GitHub after creating it

## 🛠️ Alternative: Use the Automated Scripts

We've created two automated scripts for you:

### Option 1: Run the Batch Script
```cmd
github-setup.bat
```

### Option 2: Run the PowerShell Script
```powershell
./github-setup.ps1
```

Both scripts will:
- ✅ Prompt for your GitHub username
- ✅ Prompt for repository name
- ✅ Show you the URL before proceeding
- ✅ Set up the remote connection
- ✅ Push your code to GitHub
- ✅ Provide success confirmation with repository link

## 🌐 After Pushing to GitHub

Your repository will contain:
- Complete React Todo App with all enhancements
- Professional documentation
- Test suites
- Production-ready configuration
- Mobile-responsive design
